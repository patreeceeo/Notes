# How Habits Shape Identity 

Decide what kind of person you want to become, then let that determine your processes (systems of atomic habits?). Your processes are what will determine your outcome. Do not aim for a specific outcome, instead, focus on acting like the person you want to be.

# How to build Habits

If it's visible, attractive, easy, satisfying, it's likely to become a habit. Conversely, if it's invisible, ugly, difficult, unsatisfying it's unlikely to become (or remain) a habit.

# the man who didn't look right

Change begins with awareness. A meta-habit like "pointing and calling" can make you more conscious of your habits and therefore reduce mistakes and improve your habits. Even better, down your habits and score them based on how harmonious they are with your desired identity.

# how to start a new habit

Write down a concrete plan for how you intend to implement a new habit. Use a time and place as a trigger, or stack in on to an already established habit.

My implementation intention for meditation and reading non-fiction: I have an existing habit of opening my laptop each morning. I will meditate for 10 minutes before that, and then read for 15 minutes, either in the living room, in my room, or in the office if I just rode my bike to the office.

# Motivation is overrated / Secret to self-control

Willpower isn't a good long-term strategy. Instead, design your environment in such a way that willpower isn't necessary.

# how to make a habit irresistible 

Use temptation bundling to associate something you need to do with something you have to do, because the motivation to do the thing you want to do can be harnessed, making it easier to do what you need to do.

# the role of family friends in shaping your habits

As social creatures, we want to fit in. This desire influences our habits. The groups we tend to desire to conform with are:
- The close (e.g. family, friends, coworkers)
- The many (i.e. our society, our culture)
- The powerful, or people we admire or envy
The practical implication of this being that we should try to be intentional about these groups, at least with who we regard as the close and the powerful.

# how to find and fix causes of bad habits

Every habit, even bad ones, exists because of some basic need. Associate the bad habit with the benefits of avoiding it in order to loosen its grip.

# walk slowly but never backward

The number of reps is more important than the amount of time spent practicing a habit. Aim to get results and feedback, despite potential discomfort. Don't mistake busy work (what he calls "being in motion") for results-oriented action.

# The law of least effort

Eliminate causes of friction and wasted effort in the habits you want to strengthen. Do the opposite for habits you want to break.

# How to stop procrastinating using the 2 minute rule

Develop a 2 minute ritual that gets you started on the behavior you want to make habitual e.g. calling a cab to take you to the gym. Focus on repeating that 2 minute ritual. 

# How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

Use a commitment device like Odysseus having himself tied to the mast of his ship before sailing by the sirens.

# the cardinal rule of behavior change

So far we've learned how to make it easier to perform a new behavior initially. The trick to making them stick is to appeal to our ancient brains by making them _immediately_ satisfying.

# how to stick with good habits every day

Track you habits: Use a salient, easy-to-use system for your most important/stubborn habits. Example: moving a paper clip from one jar to another after completing a sales call. Showing up on bad days is more important than performing well on any given day. Beware of how measurements can make you loose sight of what you actually want.

# how an accountability partner can change everything

Provide social pressure to follow through on your goals.

# The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)

Pick the game that you're good at, the one you enjoy or that is less painful for you than others. If such a game doesn't exist, create it. Combine two things you're above average at. Explore and exploit: There's a balance to be struck. Explore more when you're loosing or have time to spare, exploit more when you've found a winning formula, or, if running out of time, at least something that works. 

# the Goldilocks rule

Like we've already covered, being consistent with habits is crucial. An important consideration to help with consistency is to make sure that the habits you're trying to cultivate are neither too hard or too easy. The ability to stick with habits when they get boring is what separates the excellent from the merely good.

# the downside of creating good habits

Habits allow us to go on autopilot, which means we aren't aware of how well we're actually performing, or whether we could improve. To counteract this, develop meta habits of reflection and review. Be flexible, try new things, play explore/exploit. Perhaps keep a decision journal, adopt a system of quantifying and tracking performance. Keep you're identity from being tied to external things, keep it about your own qualities.

## little lessons from the four laws

Your brain constructs emotions to describe a situation.
Happiness is nothing more the absence of desire.
Suffering is gap between us and what we desire.
"Happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue." -- Victor Frankl
Peace occurs when you don't turn your observations into problems
"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how" -- Nietszche
To achieve anything, you must make desire your tool.
Desire (and emotions generally) always come before any action.
