it doesn’t matter to an ice cube how much temperature changes if it’s still below freezing. What does this have to do with habits?::sometimes we don’t see any improvement until we cross a critical threshold

# Chapter 2

Decide what kind of person you want to become, then let that determine your processes (systems of atomic habits?). Your processes are what will determine your outcome. Do not aim for a specific outcome, instead, focus on acting like the person you want to be.

# Chapter 3

If it's visible, attractive, easy, satisfying, it's likely to become a habit. Conversely, if it's invisible, ugly, difficult, unsatisfying it's unlikely to become (or remain) a habit.

# Chapter 4

Change begins with awareness. A meta-habit like "pointing and calling" can make you more conscious of your habits and therefore reduce mistakes and improve your habits. Even better, down your habits and score them based on how harmonious they are with your desired identity.

# Chapter 5

Write down a concrete plan for how you intend to implement a new habit. Use a time and place as a trigger, or stack in on to an already established habit.

My implementation intention for meditation and reading non-fiction: I have an existing habit of opening my laptop each morning. I will meditate for 10 minutes before that, and then read for 15 minutes, either in the living room, in my room, or in the office if I just rode my bike to the office.

# Chapter 6

Willpower isn't a good long-term strategy. Instead, design your environment in such a way that willpower isn't necessary.

# Chapter 7

Use temptation bundling to associate something you need to do with something you have to do, because the motivation to do the thing you want to do can be harnessed, making it easier to do what you need to do.

# Chapter 8

As social creatures, we want to fit in. This desire influences our habits. The groups we tend to desire to conform with are:
- The close (e.g. family, friends, coworkers)
- The many (i.e. our society, our culture)
- The powerful, or people we admire or envy
The practical implication of this being that we should try to be intentional about these groups, at least with who we regard as the close and the powerful.
