Platformer in which you're a penguin descended from penguins in a zoo enclosure with artificial arctic climate. The climate outside your enclosure has warmed drastically and all the humans have died and been replaced by giant reptile monsters (like dinosaurs). For some reason, you have to leave the safety of your enclosure. To find other penguins, perhaps. You have a health/power bar that begins depleting as soon as you step out. You can use various moves like throwing a snowball (attack) or freezing the floor to make it slippery that also deplete your health/power. There are ice machines around that restore your health/power. You beat a level by making it to another enclosure.
