welcome to where I share my ignorance with the world, let's dive in!

What does it mean to be sane? to have an accurate picture of what's going on "out there"? how does anyone know?

what's the relationship between being "rational" in the way the word is used in Economics, and being unselfish? rationality doesn't have to assume individual >> group.
