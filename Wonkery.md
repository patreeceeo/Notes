welcome to where I share my ignorance with the world, let's dive in!

What does it mean to be sane? to have an accurate picture of what's going on "out there"? how does anyone know?

what's the relationship between being "rational" in the way the word is used in Economics, and being unselfish? rationality doesn't have to assume individual >> group.

You are what you believe about yourself, how you judge yourself. The self does exists, but it is exactly that: A tangled web of beliefs. No more, no less. Beliefs directly effect the behavior of the meat suite, which directly effects the immediate surroundings, including the meat suite itself, and in that way, beliefs create the self's reality.

To say the mind and its beliefs are simply an emergent property of the brain seems too simple. In addition to the physical and the mental, perhaps there's a third, admittedly mystical, factor, which is the ultimate reality from which both matter and consciousness arise. It seems like the best word for this factor would be "God." 

The bigger the idea, the more far-reaching its consequences, the more likely our sentiments about the idea will be better than its execution and actual consequences e.g. capitalism and government. 

The past has been one of my biggest influences.

Modern capitalism incentivizes a singular focus, and while sometimes necessary to do great things, also carries a high risk of becoming an asshole.

Material realism is a limiting belief.

Time is the most precious way to contribute to the community. A job for the anti-community system at large that demands so much time that you feel like you can't contribute any to the community isn't something that should merely be accepted as "just the way things are," even if that job allows donating material goods to the community. Material goods come and go, but time, once spent, is gone forever.
